# POMO giant tour + Split for CVRP

This experiment separates customer sequencing from capacity decisions:

1. The POMO policy sees depot/customer coordinates and selects each customer exactly once.
2. Depot is encoder context only; it is never an action.
3. Demand and remaining capacity are not policy inputs and no capacity mask is applied.
4. At the terminal step, hard-capacity Split optimally partitions the fixed giant tour.
5. The policy-gradient reward is the negative decoded CVRP distance.

For one POMO rollout:

```text
giant tour: [4, 2, 1, 3]
Split:      [4, 2] | [1, 3]
reward:     -(d(0,4)+d(4,2)+d(2,0)+d(0,1)+d(1,3)+d(3,0))
```

The decoder uses the exact Bellman shortest-path formulation, vectorized over
all batch and POMO tours. It does not reorder customers.
